# Bluetoooth
Abstracting away bluetooth until you can get this. Bluetooth.connect(device);

This attempt at receiving and sending data simultanously isn't possible yet.
That's because the library I used din't support it.
I hope you find this as a good starting point in the future,
and the ability to send data was tested and it worked with the HC-05.
